# Cybersecurity Learning Update: Network Security, Protocols & Hardening

## Overview
In this phase of my cybersecurity learning journey, I focused on **network security**, **key protocols**, and **system hardening** strategies to protect systems from common threats.

---

## IP & MAC Addresses

- Gained a clearer understanding of **IP addresses** and **MAC addresses**.
- Explored the difference between **IPv4** (32-bit) and **IPv6** (128-bit) addressing.

---

## Categories of Network Protocols

1. **Communication Protocols** – Enable data exchange (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).
2. **Management Protocols** – Monitor and maintain network performance (e.g., SNMP).
3. **Security Protocols** – Secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS, SSH).

---

## Network Security Tools

- **Firewalls** – Control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Proxy Servers** – Act as intermediaries for requests between clients and servers.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** – Encrypt traffic and protect online privacy.

---

##  Common Network Attacks

- **DDoS Attacks** – Overwhelm systems with traffic to cause disruption.
- Learned to detect anomalies using:
  -  **Wireshark**
  -  **Tcpdump**

- **Packet Sniffing Attacks**:
  - **Passive sniffing** – Silent monitoring of traffic.
  - **Active sniffing** – Involves injecting traffic to intercept data.
  - Preventive measures: **VPN**, **HTTPS**, and **encryption protocols**.

##  Security Hardening

Security hardening minimizes vulnerabilities and reduces attack surfaces. Covered:

-  **OS Hardening**
-  **Network Hardening**
-  **Cloud Hardening**

---

## Brute Force Attack Prevention

- **Brute force attacks** involve repeated guessing of passwords.
- Defense techniques:
  -  **Salting & Hashing** passwords
  -  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** / **2FA**
  -  **CAPTCHA / reCAPTCHA**
  -  **Strong password policies**

##  Reflection

Each topic is helping me build a solid foundation in cybersecurity. Understanding how networks work, how they're attacked, and how to protect them is preparing me for real-world security challenges. I’m excited to continue growing!
